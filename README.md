# E-Commerce Store

## Description

The eCommerce Store project is a React-based web application designed to provide a dynamic and user-friendly online shopping experience. Leveraging the power of modern web technologies, this project focuses on creating a feature-rich online marketplace where users can browse, explore, and purchase a wide range of products.

- Homepage: Lists all available products and includes a real-time search bar to filter products by name. Clicking on a product navigates to the individual product page.

- Individual Product Page: Displays detailed information about a single product, including title, description, image, and reviews. Users can add products to their cart from this page.

- Cart Page: Lists the products in the user's cart, calculates the total, and provides a Checkout button for order processing.

- Checkout Success Page: Confirms successful order placement and provides a link to return to the store. The cart is cleared upon reaching this page.

- Contact Page: Contains a contact form with validation for fields such as full name, subject, email, and message body.
